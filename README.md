## About the Project
This is the second project made during Udacity classroom on "Intro to Programming".

#### Project Overview
This project is a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game: 
- The game will present some scenarios, asking you to make one of the two choices by entering 1 or 2.
- The game gives players a description of what is happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some random factors, so the game is a little bit different each time.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
