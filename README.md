A simple version of an old-fashioned text-based Adventure Game within Python.

This was one of the projects I realized during the Udacity Path "Intro to Programming" Nanodegree.

This is the second project made during Udacity classroom on "Intro to Programming".

#### Project Overview
This project is a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game: 
- The game will present some scenarios, asking you to make one of the two choices by entering 1 or 2.
- The game gives players a description of what is happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some `random factors`, so the game is a little bit different each time.
- The game has _conditions_ for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

#### Project Instructions
Feel free to customize text, properties, conditions, factors and scenarios so long as you follow the following rules.
For inspiration, you can try playing around with `random factors` and `text`.

**1. Print descriptions of what is happening for the player**: one thing the will need to do is to print messages for the player to describe what is happening.

**2. Introduce the `time.sleep` to pause between printing descriptions**: add `time.sleep` function to create suspance between the print.

**3. Give the player some choices**: up till now, the program prints the introduction of the game, with short pauses in between each sentence. Another important element of any good Adventure Game is _choice_. To do this
